The Legend of Processing 

The map layout can probably be held in a 2d array or something similar ? 

{   { top-left, top-middle, top-right }
    { center-left, center-middle, center-right }
    { bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right }   }   

something like this ^^

when hitting the border of the map, it redraws the background to match the corresponding map 
e.g. when you're in the center-middle room and you hit x == 0 --> you change to the center-left room 

There could be a room class and each position in the array holds a room object so the properties of the rooms are better held / organized 


There would be an enemy class for the one (1) type of enemy TwT 
    - holds their position and health
    - their behavior would be to walk forward until they hit the end of the map or until they hit an obstacle in the room   
    - upon which they turn around and continue walking 
    - if they come within range of the player, they attack (maybe melee, maybe projectile if im up for it)
    - if the player's attack overlaps their coordinates, they take damage  
    - if health == 0 they die and they are permanently removed from the map (maybe)

Player class 
    - holds their position and health 
    - if their coords overlap with an enemies or if they get hit with an enemy attack, they take damage 
    - if health == 0 they die 
    - they have an attack that can damage enemies 
    - if the player coords hit an opening at the ends of a room, it changes to the next room
