Meeting 2
APCSA Period 7
Shafin Kazi
The Legend of Processing

Description 

The player spawns in a room where there are multiple pathways
The map is comprised of different vertical "layers" or "levels"
Whenever entering a room horizontally, all exits are closed besides the one leading further down into the next layer / level
Each room contains different obstacles / enemies
Killing enemies can level the player up 
At a certain depth, there will be a final boss to beat
Leveling up increases ATK and HP (and potentially new skills / items)
After defeating the final boss, the player wins 

The map layout can probably be held in a 2d array or something similar 

{   { top-left, top-middle, top-right }
    { center-left, center-middle, center-right }
    { bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right }   }   

when hitting the border of the map and pressing the interact button, it redraws the background to match the corresponding map 
e.g. when you're in the center-middle room and you hit i when x == 0 --> you change to the center-left room 

Room Class 
    - holds all the obstacles and enemies and their layout in that specific room 
    - functions to place / draw obstacles / enemies and their behavior

Obstacle Class 
    - holds position and size of obstacles


Entity Class
    - holds hp, atk, position
    - contains a function that shows if you're in range with another entity
    - contains a function that shows if you're able to move to a certain spot (i.e. if there is an obstacle the edge of the map, it'll say you cannot go there)

Enemy Class extends Entity 
    - holds the range at which the enemy can detect the player  
    - if health == 0 they die and they are removed from the map
    - enemy behavior:
	- has an 80% chance to move in the direction of the player and a 20% chance to move in a random direction
        - switches directions every 5 "ticks"
	- if they are in range of the player and their attack is off cooldown, they will stop moving for a second before damaging the player

Player class extends Entity 
    - holds an inventory 
    - if health == 0 they die and the game over screen plays
    - they have attacks that can damage enemies if they are within its range  


Controls 
    - P to pause (also shows controls)
    - WASD to move
    - I to interact 	
    - J to melee attack


Functionalities / Issues (Meeting 1)
    - Currently, I have moving and collisions with obstacles (you can't go into them) 
    - I started on the map idea where pressing a button on the border of the screen takes you to a new room
    - By next meeting, I'd hope to have the map done (all the different rooms arranged and connected) 
    - Getting started on player/enemy moves would be good as well

Functionalities / Issues (Meeting 2) 
    - I started working on enemy behavior first before making the setup of each room, so I didn't exactly follow the plan I had 
    - Enemy behavior and attacking work mostly fine, however there is an issue where enemies can go through objects. It's not a very consistent bug, so I'm not too sure how to fix it. 
    - I added a pause menu as well 
    - Things still to add:
	- Layout of obstacles / enemies in each room
	- Items / Inventory 
	- EXP / Leveling up
	- Final Boss
	- Start Screen / End Screen
