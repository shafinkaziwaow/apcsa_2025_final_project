Intro
APCSA Period 7

The Legend of Processing

Description 

The player spawns in a room where there are multiple pathways, but one is blocked by a stationary enemy 
The player has to go into a room to pick up a sword, bow, and arrows 
The player can then go back and defeat the enemy with their new equipment to progress 
There would be a clear path to the final boss, but the player would be encouraged to go to different rooms so that they can explore / loot / level up (potentially) 
Leveling up increases ATK and HP
After defeating the final boss, the player wins 

The map layout can probably be held in a 2d array or something similar 

{   { top-left, top-middle, top-right }
    { center-left, center-middle, center-right }
    { bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right }   }   

Will likely be refined later to be less uniform / samey

when hitting the border of the map and pressing the interact button, it redraws the background to match the corresponding map 
e.g. when you're in the center-middle room and you hit i when x == 0 --> you change to the center-left room 

Room Class 
    - holds all the obstacles and enemies and their layout in that specific room 

Obstacle Class 
    - holds position and size of obstacles


Entity Class
    - holds hp, atk, position

Enemy Class extends Entity 
    - holds the range at which the enemy can detect the player 
    - enemy entities behavior would be to walk forward until they hit the end of the map or until they hit an obstacle in the room upon which they turn around and continue walking 
    - if they come within range of the player, they attack the area in front of them (creates a hitbox in front of them)
    - if the player's attack overlaps their coordinates, they take damage  
    - if health == 0 they die and they are removed from the map

Player class extends Entity 
    - holds an inventory 
    - if their coords overlap with an enemies or if they get hit with an enemy attack, they take damage 
    - if health == 0 they die 
    - they have attacks that can damage enemies 
    - if the player coords hit an opening at the ends of a room, it changes to the next room    


Controls 
    - WASD to move
    - I to interact 	


Functionalities / Issues 
    - Currently, I have moving and collisions with obstacles (you can't go into them) 
    - I started on the map idea where pressing a button on the border of the screen takes you to a new room
    - By next meeting, I'd hope to have the map done (all the different rooms arranged and connected) 
    - Getting started on player/enemy moves would be good as well
