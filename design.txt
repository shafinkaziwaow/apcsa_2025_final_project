Description:

The player spawns in a room where there are multiple pathways
The map is comprised of different vertical "layers" or "levels"
Whenever entering a room horizontally, all exits are closed besides the one leading further down into the next layer / level
Each layer down is harder than the previous 
Each room contains different obstacles / enemies
Killing enemies gives the player between 50 and 75 EXP
Killing bosses gives the player 100 EXP
After collecting enough EXP, the player levels up
Leveling up increases ATK, max HP, and the EXP needed to level up again
Each enemy has a chance to drop an arrow, fire arrow, and/or health potion upon death (60% / 25% / 34%)
After the third level, going down leads to the same "final room" which poses the hardest challenge
After clearing the final room, the player wins 

The map layout is held in a 2d array list 

{   { top-left, top-middle, top-right }
    { center-left, center-middle, center-right }
    { bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right, final-room }   }   

when hitting the border of the map and pressing the interact button, it redraws the background to match the corresponding map 
except for going downwards on the third level, all rooms lead to the final room
e.g. when you're in the center-middle room and you hit i when x == 0 --> you change to the center-left room
