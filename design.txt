Description 

The player spawns in a room where there are multiple pathways, but one is blocked by a stationary enemy 
The player has to go into a room to pick up a sword, bow, and arrows 
The player can then go back and defeat the enemy with their new equipment to progress 
There would be a clear path to the final boss, but the player would be encouraged to go to different rooms so that they can explore / loot / level up (potentially) 
Leveling up increases ATK and HP
After defeating the final boss, the player wins 

The map layout can probably be held in a 2d array or something similar 

{   { top-left, top-middle, top-right }
    { center-left, center-middle, center-right }
    { bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right }   }   

Will likely be refined later to be less uniform / samey

when hitting the border of the map, it redraws the background to match the corresponding map 
e.g. when you're in the center-middle room and you hit x == 0 --> you change to the center-left room 

There could be a room class and each position in the array holds a room object so the properties of the rooms are better held / organized 


Entity Class
    - holds hp, atk, position

Enemy Class extends Entity 
    - enemy entities behavior would be to walk forward until they hit the end of the map or until they hit an obstacle in the room upon which they turn around and continue walking 
    - if they come within range of the player, they attack the area in front of them (creates a hitbox in front of them)
    - if the player's attack overlaps their coordinates, they take damage  
    - if health == 0 they die and they are removed from the map

Player class extends Entity 
    - holds an inventory 
    - if their coords overlap with an enemies or if they get hit with an enemy attack, they take damage 
    - if health == 0 they die 
    - they have attacks that can damage enemies 
    - if the player coords hit an opening at the ends of a room, it changes to the next room    


Functionalities 
    - WASD to move on the map
    - j -- melee attack 
    - k -- ranged attack (only usable if you have ammo in inventory)
    - i -- interact (?) possibly if there are things to interact with
